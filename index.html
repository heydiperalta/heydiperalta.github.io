   How it affects people
   (communities, towns, countries)
Recently people have been suffering through a heat wave in new york city and because of that there was a power outage and
people were stuck everywhere work,shopping,ect. The heat provoked the black out and this powerful heat is caused by us
we have been using our resources in a negative way and destroying everything that would produce naturally and make it produce
the way we wanted (factories;causing pollution, chemical, oil)

     <p>
   how it affects the animals
   (all species)
   We are putting all animals at risk not just us. Provoking this global warming has caused us to put animals in danger of
   extiction or to be already extinct. Animals are what keeps the earth going by creating better and naural enviroments for
   us and for them selfes but sadly we are taking out every living creature slowly and rapidly.

     <p>
   How it affects the earth
   Its heating up through the inside (the core) and making its way out and also having our earth become more of a dessert than
   a world full of greenery and living creatuers where things could produce naturally not mechanically or chemically. We are
   killing the earth and us with it . START TO MAKE A CHANGE TODAY!!!
